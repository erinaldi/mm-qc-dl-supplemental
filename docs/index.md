# Matrix Models using Quantum Computing, Deep Learning, and Lattice Monte Carlo

This documentation website collects figures and tables supplementing the publication
at [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org).

We group figures and tables by the three different computational approaches used in the paper:

`quantum computation`
:   Compute the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the regularized Hamiltonian

  1. exact diagonalization
  2. hybrid quantum-classical eigensolvers


`deep learning`
:   Compute the eingestates of the regularized Hamiltonian using variational monte carlo techniques to approximate the wavefunction

`lattice monte carlo`
:   Compute the path integral of the Lagrangian using Markov Chain Monte Carlo to extract observables related to the ground state.
