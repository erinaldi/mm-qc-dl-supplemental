# Figures for the bosonic BMN matrix model

The bosonic BMN matrix model with 2 matrices and gauge group SU(2) is studied by truncating the Hilbert space at different cutoff $\Lambda$ for each boson.

There are a total of 6 bosons (3 gauge degrees of freadom for each of the 2 matrices) and the total Hilbert space is $\Lambda^6$.
